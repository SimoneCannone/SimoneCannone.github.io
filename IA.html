            <h2>About the Project</h2>
						<span class="line mb-5"></span>
						<p>

						Multi-agent system developed in Unity where different types of AI-controlled units compete against each other.
						<p>
							The system is designed to simulate autonomous decision-making, where each AI-controlled unit follows specific behaviors and adapts to dynamic conditions. These agents interact in real time, creating complex and emergent gameplay scenarios.
						</p>
						<p>
							By utilizing Unity's AI tools and custom logic, the system enables competitive and cooperative strategies among agents. The result is a dynamic environment where AI behaviors evolve, making each session unpredictable and engaging.
						</p>

		    <h2>Main Tasks</h2>
		    <span class="line mb-5"></span>
		    <p>
					The three unit types are:
		    </p>
		    <p>
						<p><b>Explorer:</b> Equipped with a node detection system that allows it to navigate the map based on previously visited areas. Once it finds something of interest, it alerts the Leader.</p>
						<p><b>Miner:</b> Responsible for gathering resources necessary for unit creation, ensuring a steady supply for expanding the unit population.</p>
						<p><b>Warrior:</b> Specializes in combat, featuring its own vision range, attack capabilities, and unique stats. It engages enemies based on strategic positioning and the Leader’s commands.</p>
		    </p>
				<p>
					Each unit has an internal finite state machine (FSM) that determines its current action and allows for a degree of autonomous decision-making. However, primary orders are issued by the Leader, which uses a message and bidding system to assign tasks efficiently. The bidding mechanism prioritizes units based on their distance to the target, ensuring that the most suitable unit executes the task in the shortest time possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					This system enables dynamic and strategic interactions between AI-controlled units, optimizing resource management, exploration, and combat effectiveness.

			<h2>Main Features</h2>
			 <span class="line mb-5"></span>

		  <div class="feature-tasks">

		    <div class="task-box">
		      <h3>State Machine</h3>
		      <p>
						Each agent has its own state machine that allows it to perform actions individually without the need for control.
 					</p>
		    </div>

		    <div class="task-box">
		      <h3>Message System</h3>
		      <p>
						Communication system between leaders and agents that allows the leader to deliver tasks to the agents through messages that are filtered by agent bids, thus determining which agent receives the task.
		      </p>
		    </div>

				<div class="task-box">
		      <h3>Map Discovery</h3>
		      <p>
						Exploration system that allows agents to move based on what explorers have already discovered, since the map is composed of nodes that are marked as visited or to be visited.
		      </p>
		    </div>

				<div class="task-box">
					<h3>Decisions</h3>
					<p>
						Decisions are made based on the agents' characteristics, since in our case, the task will always be assigned to the closest agent with the bidding system, but bidding could be based on life, strength, or anything else you specify.
					</p>
