            <h2>About the Project</h2>
						<span class="line mb-5"></span>
						<p>
							This is a personal project: a cross-platform audio library designed for seamless compatibility with both Windows and Linux. It enables efficient, low-latency playback of WAV files and features a custom-built file reader that optimizes data handling. Unlike traditional solutions that rely on OpenAL or SDL, this library interacts directly with system-level APIs—WASAPI on Windows and ALSA on Linux—allowing precise control over audio processing, buffer management, and latency optimization.
						</p>
						<p>
							Developed entirely in C++, the library leverages the language’s efficiency, portability, and memory management capabilities. Its modular architecture ensures easy expansion, with potential for additional file formats, real-time audio effects, and spatial audio support. This project highlights my expertise in low-level audio programming and cross-platform development, demonstrating my ability to create high-performance, flexible software solutions.

				<p>
			     3D Audio Support: Built-in spatial audio with panoramic positioning for an immersive sound experience. This system integrates 3D audio with panoramic sound positioning, enabling audio sources to be perceived from any direction in the 3D space. This technology enhances realism in virtual environments, such as video games or simulations, offering users an immersive and realistic audio experience by creating a natural sense of direction and depth.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			     Doppler Effect: Real-time sound distortion based on relative motion, adding realism to dynamic audio environments. The Doppler Effect simulates the change in frequency and pitch of sounds as their source moves relative to the listener. This is essential for applications like driving simulators or action games where moving sound sources (e.g., vehicles or projectiles) must be perceived with accurate tonal changes. The real-time implementation of this effect provides a more lifelike auditory experience.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			     Native API Integration: Developed using WASAPI on Windows and ALSA on Linux, ensuring low-latency and high-performance audio processing. By leveraging native APIs like WASAPI on Windows and ALSA on Linux, the system achieves precise audio resource management with minimal latency. This enables optimal sound quality and synchronization, which is critical for real-time applications that require quick, seamless audio processing, such as games or AR experiences.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			     This project demonstrates my expertise in low-level audio programming, resource management, and cross-platform development without relying on external libraries like OpenAL or SDL. By using native APIs and managing resources directly, I have full control over the audio workflow, ensuring flexibility and higher optimization, while showcasing my ability to work at the system level and implement custom audio solutions.
